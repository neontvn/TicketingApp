All the tickets that are created in the Tickets service are to be referred in the orders service as well
On each of the order doc we add the reference to the ticket that is to be purchased

1. To associate an existing Order and Ticket together

const ticket = await Ticket.findOne({});
const order = await Order.findOne({});

order.ticket = ticket
await order.save()

2. To associate an existing ticket with a *new* Order

const ticket = await Ticket.findOne({});
const order = Order.build({
    ticket : ticket,
    userId : "####",
    status : OrderStatus.Created,
    expiresAt : tomorrow 
})
await order.save()

3. To fetch an existing order from the database with its associated ticket

const order = await Order.findById("###").populate('ticket')  // gets the assocaited ticket as well
// Now can access as : 
        order.ticket.price, order.ticket.title etcetc.


To get all this working we need to have a Ticket model as well

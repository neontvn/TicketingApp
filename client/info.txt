React app made using NextJS for the auth service

NextJS - the names of files are considered as routes
         For eg. localhost:3000/file_name is a route

By default, Next.js pre-renders every page. This means that Next.js generates HTML for
each page in advance, instead of having it all done by client-side JavaScript. Pre-rendering 
can result in better performance and SEO.

Each generated HTML is associated with minimal JavaScript code necessary for that page. 
When a page is loaded by the browser, its JavaScript code runs and makes the page fully interactive. 
(This process is called hydration.)

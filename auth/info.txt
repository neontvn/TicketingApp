Database : MongoDB
MongoDB + TypeScript hai some issues 

# Issue 1 :
When User module is taken into consideration, the User object of mongoose doesnot specfically specify
the arguments that are going to be passed. Hence TypeScript would allow any kind of typo as well.

# Issue 2 :
Other properties may also get added by mongoose to a user document. Therefore TypeScript must be able 
to distinguish between the two.

- A generic User model is created to actually simplify the process of authentication
- The user email and password ( hashed using a hashing function ) is checked here.
- Password class is created which has this static functions toHash and compare that
  return the hashed password and a check if the password input is correct or not 

- Issue : How to make sure that the services get to know the user is currently logged in?

Option 1: Individual services rely on the auth service
            - Changes to auth state immediately reflected
            - Auth service goes down ? Entire app is broken

Option 2: Individual services know to authenticate a user
            - Auth service is down? Who cares!
            - Some user got banned? Might be possible that token was already given to user

Option 2 better option as there is no dependency between the services

Workaround :  Having refresh tokens we can set time after which we request for the refresh
              token. Also, we can have a short lived memory cache which will have a lifetime of
              time after which we refresh our token say 15min

Testing with Microservices

Jest - JavaScript Testing Framework

When jest starts 
    -   It will start the in-memory copy of Mongodb
    -   Start our express app
    -   Use supertest library to make fake requests to our express app
    -    Run the assertions

Testing Architecture

supertest expects to have app as a parameter to its request function. Hence I have
pulled out the creation of app logic outside the index.ts file into another file called
app.ts

Installed Dependencies : 

npm install --save-dev @types/jest @types/supertest jest ts-jest supertest mongodb-memory-server
